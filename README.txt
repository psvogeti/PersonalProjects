The master branch is the branch that has all of my projects. 
This means the master includes projects I have done in class and on my own time.  
If they are from class, I will include what class in the commit description. 
Otherwise, if there is no class code, then the project is my own completely. 

The R branch is then all of my personal projects that I have done in R
The java branch is then all of my personal proects that I have done in Java.
